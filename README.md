# A Study on the Algorithm and Implementation of SDPT3

## Abstract

This technical report presents a comprehensive study of SDPT3, a widely used open-source MATLAB solver for semidefinite-quadratic-linear programming, which is based on the interior-point method. It includes a self-contained and consistent description of the algorithm, with mathematical notation carefully aligned with the implementation. The aim is to offer a clear and structured reference for researchers and developers seeking to understand or build upon the implementation of SDPT3.
